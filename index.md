## About my road to become CKA

Wassup guys, while studying to become a CNCF CKA, i tried to document most of the labs and i chose github pages to do so. Here you will find some of the manifests i use to practice the labs.


[LimitRange](LimitRange.md) : resource limit to apply  namespace (kubectl create -f LimitRange.yaml -n mynamespace)
